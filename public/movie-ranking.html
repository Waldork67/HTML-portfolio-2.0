<hr />

<h3>Star Wars Episode III</h3>
<p>My favorite Star Wars movie because it has my favorite jedi. I also loved the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin Skywalker.</p>

<h3>Blazing Saddles</h3>
<p>I love the comedy of Mel Brooks. I think all of his movies are great but Blazing Saddles is his best one.</p>

<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>I think that this is a great movie. Quentin Tarantino makes great movies and this is my favorite.</p>
